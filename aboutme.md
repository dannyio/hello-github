For whom it may concern,

  My name is Daniel, and this is merely an introductory repository for learning and understanding Git and GitHub.
I love and mostly enjoy writing in Swift on iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and whateverisnextOS. Being a self-taught programmer,
I utilize as many tools and resources that Apple provides and especially some great free and occasionally paid for ones online.
I learn mostly from reading books even though I am a visual learner, finding that video tutorials hold your hand a lot more. Most
book tutorials I have read explain core and basic concepts and throw you challenges and exercises that provide you minimal to
just enough information to solve it on your own. It allows me to focus more and brings much satisfaction when I have completed it.

  I hope to build useful tools and applications that not only solve my problems but can hopefully solve others problems. As well
as contributing as much as possible to open source and sharing my libraries that I use in my development. Thanks for stopping
by, take care!

That is all he wrote,
Daniel.
